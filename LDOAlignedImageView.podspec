                   This lightweight UIImageView subclass controls how images are clipped in AspectFill content mode.
                   
                   By default, UIImageView centres the image, but LDOAlignedImageView can align images to prevent e.g. the top of the image from being clipped away.
                   
                   For the curious, this is implemented by adjusting the CALayerâ€™s contentsRect property.
